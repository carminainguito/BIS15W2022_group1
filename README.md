Welcome! This is our BIS 015 project repository for Data Science in Biology built by Shuyi Bian, Carmina Inguito, and Yutong Ji. 
## Project Summary
The dataset we are using is The World Happiness Report, a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The World Happiness of 2017, which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. Our task is to visualize the data to achieve a better understanding of the key factor influencing one's happiness, and the level of influences the factors hold in relation to each other and to the overall happiness.
